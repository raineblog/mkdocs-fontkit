MkDocs Fontkit is a precision font builder that allows you to self-host Adobe Fonts (Typekit), Google Fonts, and local offline fonts with minimal overhead. It uses advanced static analysis to extract font metadata and construction logic without relying on heavyweight browser automation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Typekit Static Analysis**: Ported Typekit URL generation logic (Bloom filters, hashing) to download WOFF2 files directly without Puppeteer/Playwright.
- **Google Fonts Downloader**: Automatically fetches Google Webfonts, downloads assets locally, and rewrites CSS.
- **Offline Font Splinter**: Integrates `cn-font-split` to optimize large custom fonts (CJK, Latin Modern, etc.) into chunks.
- **Production Ready**: Outputs both `fonts.css` and a minified, comment-free `fonts.min.css`.
- **Zero Browser Dependencies**: Fast, lightweight, and works in restricted environments.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
npm install -g mkdocs-fontkit
```

Or clone and use locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-fontkit.git
cd mkdocs-fontkit
npm install
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `fontkit.config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "typekit": ["your-kit-id"],
  "google": [
    "Inter:wght@400..700",
    "Fira+Code"
  ],
  "offline": [
    {
      "file": "my-local-font.otf",
      "family": "CustomSans",
      "weight": "400",
      "style": "normal"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📦 Usage

Run the build script:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be generated in the `dist/` directory:

- `dist/fonts.css`: Readable CSS.
- `dist/fonts.min.css`: Minified CSS for production.
- `dist/fonts/`: Downloaded font assets.

## 🤝 Contributions

This project is primarily maintained for personal use and I do not expect major feature contributions. However, bug reports and small corrections are always welcome.
